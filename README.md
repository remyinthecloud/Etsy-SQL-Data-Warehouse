# 🧠 Welcome to My Data Warehouse Project

Welcome to my data warehouse project focused on customer and sales data for a mock **Etsy-style shop**. This project demonstrates my ability to build a modern data warehouse using **PostgreSQL** running in a **Docker container**, perform **ETL processes**, design a scalable **data model**, and develop insightful **analytics**. 

The data simulates **ERP** and **CRM** systems, providing a real-world scenario for integrating disparate sources into a unified warehouse to support data-driven decision-making.

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### 🎯 Objective

Develop a modern data warehouse using **PostgreSQL** (deployed via Docker) to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### 📋 Specifications

- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (**ERP** and **CRM**) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Environment**: PostgreSQL database running inside a **Docker container** for isolated and portable deployment.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
