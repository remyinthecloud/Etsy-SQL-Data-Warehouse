# 🧠 Welcome to My Data Warehouse Project

Welcome to my data warehouse project focused on customer and sales data for a mock **Etsy-style shop**. This project demonstrates my ability to build a modern data warehouse using **SQL Server**, perform **ETL processes**, create a scalable **data model**, and develop insightful **analytics**. The data comes from simulated **ERP** and **CRM** systems, designed to mirror real-world complexity.

Whether you're a fellow data professional or a potential employer, this project showcases my skills in data engineering and analytics, using industry-standard tools and methodologies.
